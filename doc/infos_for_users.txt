Concepts:
1. what counts is the published data, that is what you want to share with your peers...
the experiments, studies, etc. do not really matter...

2. it's a processing engine build around the concept of a "transform". A transform is some action that you run on some data.
Usually to obtain some interesting information you will have to run at least a few transforms to produce some useful data.

3. Data, design and meta can be changed until one transform has started. Afterwards they cannot change anymore, that is to ensure the
reproducibility of the results.
However, you can always clone an experiment and start again with the same data.




Examples

1. Microarrays
example of AMS0100
design id: 072363
for the quality reporting, groups example: treatment,replicate
pca.condition=Treatment,Cell_Type
exp.factors=Treatment,Cell_Type,Replicate
